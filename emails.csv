Dear Director:

I am writing you concerning a round-trip flight from Austin, Texas, to Detroit, Michigan, I made on December 10, 2018.  
 While I’m changing planes during the return trip at DFW Airport, I was informed that  our flight would be delayed. After two hours' delay, we boarded the plane we had just left in order to meet our Chicago connection in Dallas. After take-off from DFW, our  pilot casually informed us that we should be impressed by the fact that the Dallas Cowboys football team had just left our seats. This was the only explanation of our inconvenience.  

I believe that this re-routing was done purely for promotional gain and was in no way mechanically or technically necessary. As a loyal patron of American Airlines, at least until this point, I have every  confidence that the compensation I request above will be  provided, considering the high standard of service and consideration your company has demonstrated toward its customers in the past. 
Sincerely,
","Dear Mrs.

Thank you for alerting us to the problem you have been having with our Flight . I am sorry you have been subjected to such a frustrating series of events. 
I have spoken with our manager  and have instructed him to give you a full refund plus 20% off your next Flight. I extend my own apologies for the inconvenience this problem has caused you
Kind Regards !
